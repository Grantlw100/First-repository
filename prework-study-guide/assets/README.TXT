#  PREWORK-STUDY-GUIDE

## description

-This was a demonstration project designed to help me as bootcamp student learn some of the basic fundamentals of coding.
Unfortunately throughout this prework i was incrdibly occupied with other priorities regarding work.
I do not consider this HTML to be completed. This prework experience has taught me that the simple tools i have learned
will help me develop a formal understanding regarding the processes of internet and code development. i am excited for this
bootcamp to progress and more excited to adapt this HTML to display the 47 pages of notes i have tirelessly written over the
course of 48 hours.

## table of contents
